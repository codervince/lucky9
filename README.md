##The premise:

We are running at least 2 funds comprising around 10 systems each.
These systems have been chosen from a pool of X+X+X+X+X+X winning systems. 

The funds are as diversified as possible in terms of race coverage, prices (favourites versus outsiders), AW/Turf, horse ages, class of race, grade of racecourse, season/day of week, sire, jpckey, trainer, owner based..
plus sequences*

* i.e. to mitigate the risks of losing streaks depleting the bank, it is sensible to have bets come from different systems within a day/week period spread out as much as possible since it is unlikely that several systems would be having a long losing streak at the same time...

The PRIMARY risk involved in horse racing funds of this and any sort is losing your bank before you make a profit.
We have figures on average and longest losing streak for all races over the past 7 years. 
Our assessment will try to mitigate this eventually, but the main defence is having a sufficiently large bank and a 
**The risk when playing level stakes is small. This is only an issue for percentage stakes.

Managed Funds:
The least risk investment type is levelstakes, i.e. you choose for bets to be made at a fixed amount of GBP 1 regardless of your current bank. These are the quoted ROI figures and should still return an average profit of at least 20%.  
1000 -> 1200 in 6 months.
As you can see from the systems pages the usual ROI is far greater than this, but it is best to be cautious.

Medium risk - fixed percentage of 5% (0.05 of bank).
A fall of 50% of bank due to X consecutive losses at a maximum previous recorded losing rate of X % - which would ... 

Higher Risk - percentage 10% of bank or 0.1
Higher risk, potentially greater returns. Limited to the higher a_e funds 

The systems are backing systems for GB flat racing, season 2016 only. Start date - end date.
The maturity dates are April 2nd up to and including November 5th.

You buy the fund for 1000 GBP starting capital (bank) or equivalent (depending on where BETFAIR Account is set up) or a share thereof - minimum 25% share 250 GBP at level stakes.
For the percentage stakes, minimum investment is 1000 GBP. The risk of bankruptcy is too great with low banks.
<CHECK whether 0.05 is OK>>


We may use a high ROI laying system as a hedge (10+1) and other insurance style systems wih high ROI against bank depletion.

Fee Management fee 2%
Performance Fee on profit in excess of 20% over entire fund: 5%
Withdrawal possible at end of month for 5% fee, or if bank hits stop loss %

Non-Managed Funds. Each day the candidates appear and you do the betting yourself.
At some point, I will find a way to email/IM you the list so you can make your own arrangements more easily.
You need to commit to the fund/system!! This means you must place every bet and stay the course.
We recommend you open a Betfair account.
